Concomitant fever and arthalgia are a common specific sign although infection can present with non-specific symptoms that can be confused with Dengue including headache, rash and myalgia. Free virions are transported via the blood to the liver (hepatocyte apoptosis), muscle, joints and secondary lymphoid organs (adenopathy), wherein the virus replicates. Viral replication is associated with an infiltration of mononuclear cells including macrophages, which underlies the debilitating pain experienced in the muscles and joints, which can persist for months to years post infection. A small percentage of infected individuals remain asymptomatic, this is more common in patients under 25 years old. Age over 40 years is a risk factor for chronicity of symptoms. Encephalitis, Guillain-Barre sundrome and arthritis are rare complications of infection with Chikungya virus.

The latter is characterised by initial, often massive proteinuria and microhaematuria sometimes accompanied by transient renal function impediment. All hantavirus infections are heralded by varying degrees of transient thrombocytopenia, which may serve as an indicator of clinical severity.

This disease presents with symptoms depending on the site of infection, or may be asymptomatic. Transmission is commonly by inhalation of fungal spores. Confirmation is by identification or culture of Coccidioides from affected tissue or samples, or detection of antibodies against coccidioides in serum or cerebrospinal fluid.
B50-B64;B54;B540;Protozoal diseases;Unspecified malaria;Unspecified malaria;1;F4Z;1F4Z;Certain infectious or parasitic diseases  ;Parasitic diseases;Malaria;Malaria, unspecified;A disease caused by an infection with a protozoan parasite from the Plasmodium genus. This disease commonly presents with fever, chills, headache, nausea and vomiting, or malaise. Transmission is through the bite of an infected mosquito. Confirmation is commonly by identification of the Plasmodium genus in a blood sample.

These protozoa exist as obligate intracellular parasites in human and mammalian hosts and are transmitted form host to host by certain species of sandfly. Depending on the Leishmania species involved, the resultant disease picture may range from a localised cutaneous ulcer through extensive mucocutaneous destruction to severe systemic disease.
B65-B83;B72;B720;Helminthiases;Dracunculiasis;Dracunculiasis;1;F64;1F64;Certain infectious or parasitic diseases  ;Parasitic diseases;Helminthiases;Dracunculiasis;A disease resulting from drinking water contaminated with water fleas infected with larvae of the nematode Dracunculus medinensis. It may take up to a year from ingestion of larvae for a mature gravid female worm to migrate to the skin and discharge immature larvae on contact with water. Dracunculiasis typically manifests as an intensely pruritic papule on a lower extremity from which part of the worm may emerge. Secondary pyogenic infection is common. This may be preceded by generalised symptoms such as fever, pruritus, urticaria and oedema.
